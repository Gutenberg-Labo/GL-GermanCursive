- About GL-GermanCursive font
  GL-GermanCursive is designed as German blackletter handwriting.
  We made this font as copperplate style Suetterlin and at first named it "GL-Suetterlin". However, it becomes unable to distinguish from Kurrent script, so we renamed it "GL-GermanCursive".
  This font has characters of Adobe Western 2 and some more quatations and ligatures.
